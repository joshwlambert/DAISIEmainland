\title{Calculates the percent of max age species on the island for each replicate}
\usage{
calc_max_age_percent(daisie_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{daisie_data}{List containing data of DAISIE simulation with mainland
dynamics. Output from \code{sim_island_with_mainland}.

A list. The highest level of the list has two elements called
\code{ideal_islands} and \code{empirical_islands} which corresponds to
the ideal and empirical data sets produce in each simulation. Within each
\code{ideal_islands} and \code{empirical_islands} each element is an
individual replicate. The first element of each replicate is composed of
island information containing:
\describe{
\item{\verb{$island_age}}{A numeric with the island age.}
\item{\verb{$not_present}}{the number of mainland lineages that are not
present on the island.}
}
The subsequent elements of the list pertaining to each replicate contain
information on a single colonist lineage on the island and have 3 components:
\describe{
\item{\verb{$branching_times}}{island age and stem age of the
population/species in the case of Non-endemic, Non-endemic_MaxAge and
Endemic anagenetic species.
For cladogenetic species these should
be island age and branching times of the radiation including the
stem age of the radiation.}
\item{\verb{$stac}}{An integer ranging from 1 to 6
indicating the status of the colonist:
\enumerate{
\item Non_endemic_MaxAge
\item Endemic
\item Endemic&Non_Endemic
\item Non_endemic_MaxAge
\item Endemic_singleton_MaxAge
\item Endemic_clade_MaxAge
}}
\item{\code{missing_species}}{number of island species that were
not sampled for particular clade (only applicable for endemic clades)}
}}
}
\value{
A list of two numeric vectors
}

Calculates the percent of max age species on the island for each replicate
