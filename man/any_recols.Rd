\title{Determines if the island contains any recolonisations that survived to the
present}
\usage{
any_recols(daisie_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{daisie_data}{a \link[DAISIE]{DAISIE} \code{datalist}, as can be
checked by \link{check_daisie_data}. To quote the DAISE doc:

A \code{datalist} is an object containing information on colonisation and
branching times. This object can be generated using
\link[DAISIE]{DAISIE_dataprep},
which converts a user-specified data table into a \code{datalist},
but the object can of course also be entered directly.

A \code{datalist} is a \link{list} with the following elements:

The first element of the list has two or three components:
\itemize{
\item \code{$island_age} - the island age
}

Then, depending on whether a distinction between types is
made, we have:
\itemize{
\item \code{$not_present} - the number of mainland lineages
that are not present on the island \cr
}

or:
\itemize{
\item \code{$not_present_type1} - the number of mainland lineages
of type 1 that are not present on the island
\item \code{$not_present_type2} - the number of mainland lineages of
type 2 that are not present on the island
}

The remaining elements of
the \code{datalist} each contains information on a single colonist lineage on the
island and has 5 components:
\itemize{
\item \code{$colonist_name} - the name of the species or clade that
colonized the island
\item \code{$branching_times} - island age followed by stem age of the
population/species in the case of Non-endemic, Non-endemic_MaxAge
species and Endemic species with no close relatives
on the island. For endemic clades with more than one species on the
island (cladogenetic clades/ radiations) these should be island age
followed by the branching times of the island clade including the stem
age of the clade
\item \code{$stac} - the status of the colonist, see \link{stac_to_str}
for values and descriptions
\item \code{$missing_species} - number of island species that were not
sampled for particular clade (only applicable for endemic clades)
\item \code{$type1or2} - whether the colonist belongs to type 1 or type 2
}}
}
\value{
Boolean
}
\description{
Determines if the island contains any recolonisations that survived to the
present
