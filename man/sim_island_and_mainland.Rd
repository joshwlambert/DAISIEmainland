  total_time,
  m,
  island_pars,
  mainland_ex,
  mainland_sample_prob,

  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{total_time}{Numeric defining the length of the simulation in time
units.}

\item{m}{Numeric defining the size of mainland pool.}

\item{island_pars}{A numeric vector containing the parameters for the island:
\itemize{
\item{\code{island_pars[1]}: lambda^c (cladogenesis rate)}
\item{\code{island_pars[2]}: mu (extinction rate)}
\item{\code{island_pars[3]}: K (carrying capacity), set K=Inf for
diversity independence.}
\item{\code{island_pars[4]}: gamma (immigration rate)}
\item{\code{island_pars[5]}: lambda^a (anagenesis rate)}
}}

\item{mainland_ex}{Numeric parameter for mainland extinction rate.}

\item{mainland_sample_prob}{Numeric between zero and one determining the
probability of an extant mainland species being sampled.}

\item{mainland_sample_type}{String either "unsampled" for unsampled known
species on the mainland, "undiscovered" for undiscovered species on the
mainland, or "complete" if the mainland sampling probability is one.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, determining if progress output should be printed
during the simulation.}
}
\value{
a list with elements
\itemize{
\item \code{mainland}
\item \code{ideal_island}
\item \code{empirical_island}
