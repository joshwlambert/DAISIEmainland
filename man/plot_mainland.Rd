\title{Plot the simulated mainland.}
\usage{
plot_mainland(mainland)
}
\arguments{
\item{mainland}{the evolutionary history of the mainland species,
as created by \link{sim_mainland}.
Use \link{plot_mainland} to visualise the that evolutionary history.}
}
\value{
a \code{ggplot2} facet plot, where each facet/row contains
the evolutionary history of a clade.
Per clade, the x axis shows the time from past (at the left)
to the present (at the right).
The y-axis has no meaning except for separating the different
species using \link{branch_code_to_y}.
