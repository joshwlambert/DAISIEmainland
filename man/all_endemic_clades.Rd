\title{Checks if all island species are endemic clades. Clade are colonisations that
have formed an island clade of two or more species surviving to the present.}
\usage{
all_endemic_clades(island)
}
\arguments{
\item{island}{The history of a a single island,
as can be checked by \link{check_island}.

An \code{island} is \link{list} with two elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{ideal_island}: the island history based on ideal data,
as can be checked by \link{check_ideal_island}
\item \code{empirical_island}: the island history based on empirical data
as can be checked by \link{check_empirical_island}
}}

Boolean

Checks if all island species are endemic clades. Clade are colonisations that
have formed an island clade of two or more species surviving to the present.
