\title{Plot the simulated ideal island.}
\usage{
plot_ideal_island(ideal_island)
}
\arguments{
\item{ideal_island}{a simulated island with perfect information,
which is a \link{list} of one or more \link{ideal_island_clade}s.

An \code{ideal_island} is created by \link{sim_island} (together with \code{empirical_island},
which has imperfect information),
as can be checked by \link{check_ideal_island}}
}
\value{
a \code{ggplot2}
}
\description{
Plot the simulated ideal island.
}

mainland_clade <- DAISIEmainland:::create_test_mainland_clade(

These are the functions to plot an evolutionary history:
\itemize{
\item Use \link{plot_mainland} to plot the mainland history
\item Use \link{plot_island} to plot the island history.
based on both empirical data and ideal data.
\item Use \link{plot_empirical_island} to plot the island history.
based on empirical data.
\item Use \link{plot_ideal_island} to plot the island history
based on ideal data.
