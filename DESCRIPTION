Description: Simulates data for the DAISIE model. The simulation includes
    the mainland and island, and produces two data sets: 1) the ideal data set
    includes all the information, and 2) the reality data set prunes the ideal
    data to include what would be seen by an empiricist producing phylogenetic
    data from extant species.
