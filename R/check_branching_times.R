#' Check if a `branching_times` is valid.
#' Will \link{stop} if not
#'
#' `branching_times` contains:
#'
#'  * for cladogenetic species: the island age
#'    and branching times of the radiation,
#'    including the stem age of the radiation
#'  * for non-endemic, non-endemic_MaxAge and
#'    Endemic anagenetic species:
#'    island age and stem age of the population/species
#'
#' A valid `branching_times` ...
#'
#'  * is numeric
#'  * has only finite values
#'  * has at least 1 element (which equals the island age)
#'  * has only positive non-zero values (although zero is accepted, to prevent
#'    false negatives by rounding off errors)
#'  * has a descending order
