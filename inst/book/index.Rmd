# DAISIEmainland guide {-}

This guide is the long-form documentation of the DAISIEmainland R package.
It covers the basics from installation (Section \@ref(Installation)), to the
algorithm used to simulate the data (Section \@ref(Simulation-algorithm)), and
the visualisation of the island (Section \@ref(visualise-island)) and of the 
mainland (Section \@ref(visualise-mainland)). Then there is a demonstration of
the application of the `DAISIEmainland` package to the inference models in the 
`DAISIE` package (Section \@ref(Inference-performance)). Lastly, there is the
visualisation of the summary metrics that can be calculated from simulated data
(Section \@ref(Summary-metric-visualisation)). 

## Overview {-}

The `DAISIEmainland` package is used for simulating an island-mainland system.
It primary purpose is the simulation of phylogenetic data sets of island species
under a realistic model that incorporates evolutionary dynamics on the island and 
the mainland, from which the island species immigrate. This is in contrast to the
inference and simulation models included in the `DAISIE` package which do not
incorporate any changes in the mainland species through time. 

This novel model of mainland dynamics opens up the possibility of testing the 
robustness of the `DAISIE` likelihood models under various scenarios of mainland
dynamics. We also include the incomplete sampling of mainland species, either by
not sampling a known species or an undiscovered species which is present on the 
mainland but not known. These different sampling regimes are both possible in 
empirical studies and thus the sensitivity of model performance to these are 
important for future studies employing the `DAISIE` inference framework.
