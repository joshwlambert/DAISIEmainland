# Installation

## Installation

You can install the released version of DAISIEmainland from github with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("joshwlambert/DAISIEmainland")
```

The `DAISIEmainland` package has several dependencies (the entire list can be
found in the DESCRIPTION file). Most of these are on CRAN and can be installed with
`install.packages()`. However, the DAISIE and nLTT packages require more
up-to-date version than available on CRAN and need to be installed from github:

``` r
remotes::install_github("rsetienne/DAISIE")
remotes::install_github("thijsjanzen/nLTT")
```

Load the DAISIEmainland package with the `library()` function. This will also
load the package dependencies, specifically the DAISIE package which will be
used later on for parameter estimation by fitting maximum likelihood models.

```{r load package}
library(DAISIEmainland)
```
