	abstract = {Abstract
          Understanding macroevolution on islands requires knowledge of the closest relatives of island species on the mainland. The evolutionary relationships between island and mainland species can be reconstructed using phylogenies, to which models can be fitted to understand the dynamical processes of colonisation and diversification. But how much information on the mainland is needed to gain insight into macroevolution on islands? Here we first test whether species turnover on the mainland and incomplete mainland sampling leave recognisable signatures in community phylogenetic data. We find predictable phylogenetic patterns: colonisation times become older and the perceived proportion of endemic species increases as mainland turnover and incomplete knowledge increase. We then analyse the influence of these factors on the inference performance of the island biogeography model DAISIE, a whole-island community phylogenetic model that assumes that mainland species do not diversify, and that the mainland is fully sampled in the phylogeny. We find that colonisation and diversification rate are estimated with little bias in the presence of mainland extinction and incomplete sampling. By contrast, the rate of anagenesis is overestimated under high levels of mainland extinction and incomplete sampling, because these increase the perceived level of island endemism. We conclude that community-wide phylogenetic and endemism datasets of island species carry a signature of mainland extinction and sampling. The robustness of parameter estimates suggests that island diversification and colonisation can be studied even with limited knowledge of mainland dynamics.},
